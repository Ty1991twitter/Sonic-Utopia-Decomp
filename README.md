## Sonic-Utopia-Decomp

Hello and welcome to the Sonic Utopia Decomp Repo

So, Sonic Utopia's been out for a little while and I got bored so I said why don't I decompile it so here it is!

THIS IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS. I HAVE TO REMAKE ALOT OF SHIT.

## Requirements

- If you're on a 64 bit windows download this: [Unity 5.4.1 Editor 64 bit](https://download.unity3d.com/download_unity/649f48bbbf0f/Windows64EditorInstaller/UnitySetup64-5.4.1f1.exe)
- 
- If you're on 32 bit windows download this: [Unity 5.4.1 Editor 32 bit](https://download.unity3d.com/download_unity/649f48bbbf0f/Windows32EditorInstaller/UnitySetup32-5.4.1f1.exe)
